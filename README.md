At this very moment we are working in the transformation a real life Business Plan into an autonomous smart contract governed by a DAO. Not easy task, but we have already started. this is the path we are following:

- standard excel business plan
- transform excel to manage equations and relations among variables, so that we link our monetary policy to our business plan.
- python code to import from excel and execute it with and html output.

(up to here you can find it at zip available in repository)

- user adoption and sales must be related and expresed monthly rather than yearly.
- transform python program into an smart contract (SC) such as given user sign-ups and sales as input, it can execute monetary policy (Monetary Policy Smart Contact, MPSC) .
- an smart contract capable of sourcing both sales and sign-ups data as input to previous MPSC.
- Int he future this input values will be collected from a decenralized blockchain to be chosen or designed.
